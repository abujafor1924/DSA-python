'''
An array in Python (via the array module) stores
elements of the same type efficiently but offers
limited functionality. A NumPy array (ndarray) is more powerful,
supporting multi-dimensional data, broadcasting, vectorized operations,
and numerous mathematical functions, making it ideal for
scientific computing and data analysis.
